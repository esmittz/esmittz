- 👋 Hi, I’m @esmittz!
- 👀 I’m interested in rock climbing, history, The Stormlight Archives, amazing food, just about anything nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a full-stack developer. Current focus is web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm learning pretty much from scratch and want to build projects to add to my portfolio. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Product Manager looking to become a combo dev and PM.
